# Next steps

The Three.js browser spike at [spikes/threejs-sea-trial/](spikes/threejs-sea-trial/) proved the vertical-slice loop. **It is not the production path.** The final game target is an **engineless native C++ game using selected libraries** — see [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md). The next build target is a custom C++ vertical slice.

## Immediate

**Milestone 0 is complete** ✅ — [native/](native/):

- [x] Native model self-tests pass — pure C++, verified on g++ (MSYS2 UCRT64) and MSVC 2022, and in CI
- [x] Builds from a clean checkout, exits cleanly, `ctest`-wired
- [x] SDL3 native window opens (release-3.4.10, static submodule)
- [x] bgfx clears the screen (Direct3D 11 auto-selected)
- [x] Dear ImGui debug panel renders (v1.92.8, self-contained bgfx renderer) — shows the 11 self-tests + Test Sloop stats, visually verified
- [x] Vendoring mechanic resolved: **pinned git submodules** under `extern/` (SDL, bgfx.cmake, imgui)

## Next (post-Milestone 0)

- [x] Ship rendering — the Test Sloop draws as 3D oriented boxes (one per hull piece) via bgfx debugdraw, orbit camera, colored by type/damage.
- [x] Buoyancy on the floating ship — `sea::computeFloatPose` derives heave + pitch + heel from the wave surface at the Tier-2 sample points, offset by float margin (heavier rides lower). The ship bobs and tilts on the real waves; live values in the panel. Covered by a self-test.
- [x] Shader pipeline — shaderc + `bgfx_compile_shaders` (D3D11 profile), app forces the D3D11 renderer. Reusable for all future shaders.
- [x] GPU water — solid lit ocean: a dense grid displaced in the vertex shader by the *same* wave sum as `sea::sampleWater` (params passed as uniforms, so it still matches buoyancy), with N·L shading, fresnel, and crest foam. Replaced the CPU wireframe.

## Next (post-water)

- [x] Ship on lit meshes — each hull piece is a lit box (per-face N·L + ambient) on the shader pipeline; debugdraw removed entirely (water + ship are both GPU now). `src/ship_mesh.*`, `shaders/{vs,fs}_mesh.sc`.
- [x] Interactive cargo/damage — the ship is live: a cargo slider + Damage/Repair/Reset buttons + keys (C/V/X/Z/R) feed straight into buoyancy. Overloading or breaking planks drops the float margin, the ship rides lower, then **founders and sinks beneath the waves** (progressive sink accumulation); lighten it or repair in time and it recovers. Panel shows live status (afloat / SINKING), cargo, damage, float margin.
- [x] Sailing (Black Flag control scheme) — W/S step sail tiers (anchored / half / full), A/D steer (more agile at low speed), chase camera behind the heading. Ship-centric: the hull stays at the origin and the ocean scrolls past (wave field sampled at the ship's virtual world position, so buoyancy stays consistent). See [references/black-flag.md](references/black-flag.md).
- [x] Wind + visible sail (Black Flag style) — a wind direction drifts over time; you make best speed running with it (downwind → 100% drive) and least beating into it (upwind → ~55%). Panel shows the wind bearing + tail/cross/head + drive %. A mast + canvas sail now render on the hull (data-driven on the ship's mast/sail counts) and the sail trims partway toward the wind.
- [x] Black Flag control scheme, matched to the researched original — see [references/black-flag.md](references/black-flag.md#sailing-controls-researched-matched-in-the-native-prototype). Four discrete sail states (**anchored / half sail / full sail / travel speed**); **half sail is the spawn/cruise baseline**; **W** taps sail up and **holding W at full latches travel speed** (the tap-vs-hold split); **S** steps down and coasts to a stop with **no reverse**; **turn radius inversely coupled to speed** (~77°/s pivot at a dead stop vs ~48°/s at travel — the stop-to-turn tactic, verified live); the **visible sail reefs with the state** (furled → half → full). Wind-gating kept as a deliberate enhancement over BF's wind-neutral model.
- [x] Naval gunnery — **Space fires a broadside** at a drifting target ship. Cannonballs (one per cannon, spread along the hull, lobbed from whichever side faces the target) arc under gravity and, on hitting the target's hull box, flood its planks — so the target progressively **founders and sinks**, reusing the existing buoyancy/damage/sink loop. Projectile/hit/damage logic lives in the pure-C++ model spine (`fireBroadside`/`stepProjectiles`/`resolveHits`/`pointInHull`) with **6 self-tests (18/18 total)**. Renders the target hull + tracer cannonballs at world-relative positions.
- [ ] Mouse camera control (drag-orbit / scroll-zoom) — also unlocks Black Flag's real *camera-direction* weapon selection (side/front/rear).
- [ ] The full Build → Sail loop per [vertical-slice.md](vertical-slice.md); Jolt + Steamworks after.

## Done

- [x] Slice scope defined ([vertical-slice.md](vertical-slice.md))
- [x] Web spike (React + Three.js) with Gerstner waves, Tier 2 sampling, ship JSON, validation, cargo/damage/sinking ([spikes/threejs-sea-trial/](spikes/threejs-sea-trial/))
- [x] 11/11 self-tests passing in the web spike — model-spine regression gate
- [x] Engine direction locked: engineless C++ stack ([tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md))
- [x] Version control (this repo)

## Later

- Open-world content (islands, quests, etc. — explicitly held back per slice §25)
- Real Steam Workshop integration (web spike used local `/user_ships/` as stand-in)
- Multiplayer beyond the slice's optional Phase 8 mini-test
